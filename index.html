<p>Savefiles made with a particular version can often only be loaded by that version; unfortunately, I currently don't have the development time to invest in changing this.  However, <a href="https://github.com/cynic/elm-lct">the code is open-source</a>, so you are welcome to contribute to it.  (If you find a bug or have a suggestion about the tool, you can report it <a href="https://github.com/cynic/elm-lct/issues">here</a>).</p>

<p>If you REALLY want to load older files into a newer version, <a href="mailto:y.motara@ru.ac.za?subject=File conversion">contact</a> me and I'll try to make a plan for you, depending on how much time I have to spare.  (and then please try to stick to that newer version for a while ðŸ™‚ because it will make everyone very happy)</p>

<p>Elm-LCT is free software; to know precisely what that means, read the <a href="LICENSE.txt">license</a>.</p>
